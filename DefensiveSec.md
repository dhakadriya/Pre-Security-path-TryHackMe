📌 Room Overview
This TryHackMe room introduces the concept of Defensive Security, which focuses on protecting systems against cyber threats by preventing intrusions, detecting malicious activities, and responding to security incidents effectively.

The room highlights the role of Blue Teams in monitoring and defending organizational infrastructure using industry-standard methodologies such as:

Security Operations Center (SOC)

Threat Intelligence

Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)

Malware Analysis

🎯 Objectives
Understand Defensive Security concepts

Learn the role of Blue Teams

Explore SOC operations

Understand Threat Intelligence

Learn DFIR methodologies

Understand Malware Analysis techniques

Investigate alerts using a simulated SIEM

📍 Task 1: Introduction to Defensive Security
Defensive Security focuses on:

Preventing cyber intrusions

Detecting attacks when they occur

Responding to security incidents

Some common defensive security practices include:

User cybersecurity awareness training

Asset documentation and management

System patching and updates

Firewall and IPS deployment

Network logging and monitoring

✅ Answer:
Blue Team

📍 Task 2: Areas of Defensive Security
🏢 Security Operations Center (SOC)
A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a team of cybersecurity professionals responsible for continuously monitoring systems and networks to detect and respond to security threats.

SOC teams primarily monitor:

System vulnerabilities

Policy violations

Unauthorized activities

Network intrusions

🧠 Threat Intelligence
Threat Intelligence involves:

Collecting security-related data

Processing and analyzing threat information

Identifying adversaries

Predicting attacker behavior

Preparing mitigation strategies

It helps organizations build a threat-informed defense strategy.

🔬 Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)
DFIR involves investigating cyber incidents and analyzing digital evidence.

Key Investigation Areas:

File Systems

System Memory

System Logs

Network Logs

🧯 Incident Response Phases:
Phase	Description
Preparation	Develop readiness for incidents
Detection & Analysis	Identify and analyze threats
Containment, Eradication & Recovery	Stop and remove threats
Post-Incident Activity	Document lessons learned

🦠 Malware Analysis
Malware refers to malicious software such as:

Virus

Trojan Horse

Ransomware

Types of Analysis:
Static Analysis → Examining malware without executing it

Dynamic Analysis → Running malware in a controlled environment

✅ Answers:

SOC Monitoring Team:
Security Operations Center

DFIR Stands For:
Digital Forensics and Incident Response

Malware That Requires Payment:
ransomware

📍 Task 3: Practical Example of Defensive Security
In this task, a simulated SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system was used to investigate security alerts generated within a banking environment.

SIEM tools:
Collect logs from multiple sources

Analyze security events

Detect suspicious activities

Generate alerts for analysts

The analyst's role is to:

Investigate login failures

Analyze unknown IP connections

Identify potential threats

Respond to malicious activity

After investigating alerts within the SIEM simulation, the following flag was obtained.

🏁 Flag:
THM{THREAT-BLOCKED}

🛠️ Tools Used
